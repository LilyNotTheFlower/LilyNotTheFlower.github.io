<!-- <h2>Javacript Entry</h2> -->
<p>10/21/24,</p><p> we started to learn javascript! I made a few <p>functions and click thingys so the screen changes colors.</p> <p> I also made a alert for halloween.</p>
<p>11/07/24, </p><p>we worked on our websites! I drew a image I am </p> <p>going to use and also connected my pages better.</p>
<p>11/12/24, </p><p>we worked on functions. I am making a plant but </p> <p>I am having trouble getting it to fill the whole div.</p>
<p>11/18/25, </p><p>we worked on our functions a bit and I worked </p> <p>on my website. I am having a bit of trouble generally </p> <p> organizing but I will manage. I also talked to Molly for </p> <p>help.</p><p>12/02/24,</p> <p> We did functions to change the color of things randomly and also based on where the mouse is. It was a bit confusing though.</p><p>12/16/24,</p><p> Today we were trying to learn how to use if statements and else if. It was hard to understand, but I think I got it.</p><p>02/12/25,</p><p> I havent updated in a while but I am working on a Valentines Day Project and previously made a confetti project. Its not done, but I hope Steph likes it.</p><p>02/27/25,</p><p> Today we talked a lot about different things we were strugglign with and didn't code. We did lots of for loops and also </p><p>integrating keyframes. It was really helpful becuase I often stuggle to remember how to do things like that.</div>
